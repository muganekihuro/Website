                    Beginning just an hour north of Campbell River and stretching towards Sayward, the North Island region unfolds to the windswept tip at Cape Scott, encompassing the rugged Pacific coast and extending east to the whale-rich waters, including sections of the Great Bear Rainforest and BC mainland. Top of the wishlist for visitors are whale and bear sightings, and the region offers group outings on comfortable cabin cruisers or thrilling open-air Zodiacs in pursuit of orcas, humpback whales, porpoises, Steller sea lions, Minke whales, and harbour seals. 
                    The prime season from May to October is ideal for nautical excursions from Northern Vancouver Island to the mainland's grizzly bear habitats.</p>
